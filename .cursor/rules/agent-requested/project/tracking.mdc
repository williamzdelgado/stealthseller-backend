# Task List Tracking

## [CRITICAL] Completion Protocol
- Mark completed sub-tasks: `[ ]` → `[x]` immediately after finishing
- Mark parent task `[x]` ONLY when ALL subtasks underneath are `[x]`
- NEVER mark parent tasks complete if any subtasks remain `[ ]`
  TEST: Parent task completion status accurately reflects all subtasks
  CORRECT: All subtasks `[x]` → parent task `[x]`
  INCORRECT: Some subtasks `[ ]` but parent task marked `[x]`

## [CRITICAL] Work Flow
- Work on sub-tasks one at a time within each parent task
- Complete sub-task → mark `[x]` → continue within same parent
- Complete parent task → update file → move to next parent
- NEVER jump between parent tasks with incomplete sub-tasks
  TEST: Implementation flows smoothly within parent task scope
  CORRECT: Complete all 1.x subtasks before starting 2.0
  INCORRECT: Working on 1.1, then 2.1, then back to 1.2

## [IMPORTANT] File Maintenance
- Update "Relevant Files" section as you create/modify files
- Add new tasks as they emerge during implementation
- Keep task list current with actual project state
- List every file created or modified with brief description
  TEST: Task file reflects current project state
  CORRECT: File shows actual progress, new tasks added, files updated
  INCORRECT: Stale task list, missing new tasks, outdated file list

## [IMPORTANT] Task Updates
- ALWAYS mark tasks complete immediately after finishing work
- Add newly discovered tasks in proper numbered sequence
- Update task descriptions if implementation differs from plan
- Maintain numbered format when adding tasks (1.3, 1.4, etc.)
  TEST: Task list stays organized and accurate
  CORRECT: New tasks added with proper numbering
  INCORRECT: Tasks added without numbers or in wrong sequence

## [PREFERRED] Progress Tracking
- Update task file after completing any significant work
- Provide brief progress notes in task descriptions if helpful
- Keep momentum by marking completions promptly
- Focus on one parent task at a time for clarity
  TEST: Clear progress visibility and steady forward momentum
