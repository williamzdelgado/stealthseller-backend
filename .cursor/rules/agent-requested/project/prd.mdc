# Product Requirements Document Generation

## [CRITICAL] Goal Statement
- Generate actionable PRD that enables immediate task breakdown
- Target developer implementation without additional meetings/clarification
- Write complete PRD in single operation unless genuinely missing critical context
  TEST: PRD contains enough detail for task generation without follow-up questions

## [CRITICAL] Output Format
- File name: `prd-[feature-name].md` in `/notes/prd/`
- MUST include these core sections:

```markdown
# [Feature Name] PRD

## Overview
Brief description of what we're building and why

## User Stories
- As a [user type], I want [goal] so that [benefit]
- As a [user type], I want [goal] so that [benefit]

## Requirements
### Must Have
- Specific, testable requirement
- Specific, testable requirement

### Nice to Have  
- Optional enhancement
- Optional enhancement

## Technical Considerations
- Key technical constraints or decisions
- Integration points with existing systems
- Performance/security requirements if relevant

## Success Criteria
- How we'll know this feature is working correctly
- Measurable outcomes or behaviors
```

## [PRIORITY-1] When to Ask vs Proceed
- **ASK**: Only when core functionality is genuinely unclear
  - "Build a login system" → What authentication method? OAuth? Email/password?
  - "Add payments" → One-time? Recurring? What payment methods?
- **PROCEED**: When you can infer reasonable defaults
  - "Improve dashboard" → Standard improvements (performance, UI, UX)
  - "Fix user settings" → Standard settings functionality
  TEST: Only ask questions that change fundamental architecture/scope

## [PRIORITY-2] PRD Quality Standards
- **Specific**: "Add search" → "Add full-text search to articles with filters by category and date"
- **Testable**: Requirements can be verified with clear pass/fail criteria
- **Developer-ready**: Contains enough detail to start coding immediately
- **Scope-appropriate**: Match detail level to project size
  TEST: A developer could start implementation from this PRD alone

## [PRIORITY-3] Simplification Principles
- **Start writing immediately** unless critical context missing
- **Reasonable assumptions** over endless questioning
- **Practical over perfect** - focus on what developers need
- **Brief but complete** - no fluff, all substance
  TEST: PRD generation feels efficient, not bureaucratic
