## [CRITICAL] Query Writing
- ALWAYS use conversational questions instead of keyword strings
- Include specific context: framework, language, year, use case
- Be specific about what you want: examples, comparisons, step-by-step guides
TEST: Query reads like a question you'd ask a colleague

## [CRITICAL] Recency Parameter Usage
- Use `day` for breaking news or very recent updates
- Use `week` for recent developments or current trends
- Use `month` (default) for general technical research
- Use `year` for established practices or broader context
TEST: Recency matches the urgency/freshness needs of your query

## [IMPORTANT] Technical Query Structure
- Request specific output formats: "Create a comparison table", "List pros and cons"
- Include year (2025) when asking about best practices or tool comparisons
- Ask for code examples and common pitfalls when relevant
TEST: Query specifies the type of response you need

## [PREFERRED] Query Templates

### Technical How-To
"How do I [specific task] in [language/framework]? Include [code examples/common pitfalls/best practices]."

### Tool Comparison  
"Compare [Tool A] vs [Tool B] for [specific use case] in 2024. Focus on [performance/ease of use/community support]."

### Troubleshooting
"I'm getting [specific error] when [specific action]. What are the most common causes and solutions?"

### Current Best Practices
"What are the current best practices for [topic] in [technology] as of 2025?"
