# @trigger-deploy

## [CRITICAL] Deployment Command
- npx trigger.dev@3.3.17 deploy --env staging
- Deploy trigger.dev functions to staging environment
- Verify deployment completion

## [IMPORTANT] Troubleshooting Import Errors
- Check trigger directory for actual files before deployment
- Remove imports for non-existent modules from trigger/index.ts
- Only export files that actually exist
- Fix "Could not resolve" errors by verifying file existence
- Use `ls trigger/` to see which files are available
TEST: All imports in trigger/index.ts should resolve to actual files

TEST: Deployment should complete successfully with staging environment
