# @test-deploy

## [CRITICAL] Testing Flow
- Wait we need to test what we just did, push to supabase staging
- Use Supabase MCP for database operations
- Staging branch: nlydrzszwijdbuzgnxzp
- Use CLI to update functions
TEST: Always test locally before staging deployment

## [IMPORTANT] Deployment Pattern
- Test locally first
- Deploy to staging environment
- Verify functionality after deployment
- Use proper staging credentials

CORRECT: Test → Deploy → Verify
INCORRECT: Deploying without testing verification
