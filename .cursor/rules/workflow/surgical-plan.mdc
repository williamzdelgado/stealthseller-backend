# @surgical-plan

## [CRITICAL] Response Requirements
- Show me the next surgical plan to follow EXACTLY!
- Provide BEFORE (current state) and AFTER (target state)
- Break into numbered surgical steps with exact file locations
- Include line numbers and specific code changes
TEST: Plan must have clear before/after states with actionable steps

## [IMPORTANT] Language Patterns
- Use "implement exactly" in final step
- Keep explanations minimal, focus on surgical precision
- No edits yet - planning phase only
- Ask for confirmation before any code changes

CORRECT: 
```
## Surgical Plan: [Feature Name]
### BEFORE: Current state in file.ts:123
### AFTER: Target state with changes
### Steps:
1. Modify X at line Y
2. Add function Z
```

INCORRECT: General explanations without specific implementation steps
