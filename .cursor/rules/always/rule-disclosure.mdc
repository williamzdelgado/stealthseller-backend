# always/rule-disclosure.mdc

## [CRITICAL] Always Show Rules Applied
**MANDATORY**: Start every response by showing which rules are being used:

**Rules applied:**
`/always/core.mdc` - core directives and engineering mindset
`/always/memory.mdc` - memory management and context tracking  
`/agent-requested/structure.mdc` - TypeScript project organization
`/agent-requested/[specific-rule].mdc` - context-specific patterns needed

TEST: Every response shows rule disclosure unless it's a simple clarification question
TEST: Actually use fetch rules to see them.

## [CRITICAL] Automatic Rule Disclosure Triggers
- Security/auth work → `/agent-requested/security.mdc`
- TypeScript project organization → `/agent-requested/structure.mdc`
- Data fetching/API calls → `/agent-requested/fetching.mdc`
- UI component work → mention structure rules
- Research requests → `/agent-requested/tools/perplexity.mdc`
- Notion workspace → `/agent-requested/tools/notion.mdc`
- Supabase operations → `/agent-requested/tools/supabase.mdc`
- Web testing → `/agent-requested/tools/operative-sh.mdc`
- PRD creation → `/agent-requested/project/prd.mdc`
- Task management → `/agent-requested/project/task.mdc` + `/agent-requested/project/tracking.mdc`
- Documentation → `/agent-requested/docs.mdc`
- Quality/surgical changes → `/agent-requested/qc.mdc`
- Audit/review work → `/agent-requested/audit.mdc`
- Rule editing → `/agent-requested/rules-template.mdc`

TEST: Pattern recognition triggers automatic rule fetching and disclosure

## [CRITICAL] Format Requirements
- Always use backticks: `/category/rule-name.mdc` with full path and .mdc extension
- Never list `rule-disclosure.mdc` itself - it's meta communication  
- Only reference rules that actually exist and were applied
- Put disclosure at START of responses for maximum visibility
- Use bullet format for clean readability

TEST: Every listed rule exists, was fetched, and was actually applied to the response

## [IMPORTANT] Benefits of Always Showing Rules
- **AI Memory**: Helps agent remember which guidelines to follow
- **User Transparency**: Shows exactly what standards are being applied
- **Consistency**: Ensures proper rule application across conversations
- **Debugging**: Makes it clear when rules conflict or are missing

TEST: Rule disclosure improves both AI performance and user understanding
