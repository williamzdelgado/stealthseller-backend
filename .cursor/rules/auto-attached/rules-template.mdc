## [CRITICAL] Structure Requirements
- Use proper frontmatter with description, globs, and alwaysApply
- Keep rules under 500 lines total
- Start with priority-tagged sections: `[CRITICAL]`, `[IMPORTANT]`, `[PREFERRED]`
- Include verification criteria with "TEST:" for each rule

## [CRITICAL] Effective Language Patterns
- Use specific, actionable language: "Use functional components" not "write good code"
- Start with action verbs: "Use", "Never", "Always", "Verify"
- Include authoritative keywords: `[CRITICAL]`, `[IMPORTANT]`, "MUST", "NEVER"
- Be direct and terse - avoid explanatory text

## [IMPORTANT] Priority Classification System
- `[CRITICAL]` - System breaks/security risk without this
- `[IMPORTANT]` - Quality/maintainability suffers
- `[PREFERRED]` - Best practice recommendations
TEST: Every rule should have a clear priority tag

## [IMPORTANT] Example Patterns
- Provide CORRECT/INCORRECT code examples with labels
- Show what NOT to do alongside preferred patterns
- Include deprecated pattern examples marked "DO NOT USE"
- Use contrastive examples for better AI comprehension

## [IMPORTANT] Rule Structure Template
```
## SECTION [PRIORITY]
- [ACTION] [SPECIFIC REQUIREMENT] - [BRIEF RATIONALE]
  TEST: [VERIFICATION CRITERIA]
  CORRECT: [CODE EXAMPLE]
  INCORRECT: [ANTI-PATTERN]
```

## [IMPORTANT] Description Writing
- Start with "Use when..." followed by simple, clear action
- Keep descriptions short and specific to avoid confusion
- Focus on one main trigger scenario per rule

## [PREFERRED] Rule Types
- Always (`alwaysApply: true`): Core project standards only
- Auto (`globs: ["*.ts"]`): Language/file-specific patterns
- Agent (`description: "..."`): Context-dependent best practices
- Manual: Specialized workflows, explicit `@rulename` only

## [PREFERRED] File Organization
- Location: `.cursor/rules/category/name.mdc`
- Naming: kebab-case, descriptive single words when possible
- Split large concepts into multiple focused rules
TEST: Each rule should focus on one specific domain or concern
